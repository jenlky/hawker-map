    text: 'Hai Kee Noodle was one of those stalls that I came across by chance when I was exploring Toa Payoh Lorong 8 Market & Food Centre.\n' +
      'When I patronised them on 2 separate occasions, there was a friendly aunty sitting outside the stall. She took orders while hand-making the wantons and dumplings, while her son took charge of the cooking and serving.\n' +
      'The menu only specialises in 3 dishes. Wanton Noodle (S$3.50), Dumpling Noodle (S$4), and Chicken Feet Noodle (S$5).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'I ordered the Wanton Noodle, and I was astonished with what was served to me. It came with a generous amount of char siew and green veggies piled on top of the mee kia with a side bowl of soup with 3 wantons.\n' +
      '“All that for S$3.50? How are they earning money?” I thought to myself.\n' +
      'Every strand of noodle managed to soak up the delectable gravy and made me reminisce about the the old-school taste of great wanton mee that many establishments fail to achieve nowadays.\n' +
      'The wanton filling was also well marinated and delicious. Even the clear broth that came with it was robust in flavour and naturally sweet. Try it for yourself and you’ll know what I mean.\n' +

      'The selections include classic crowd favourites like Spring Chicken (Half) (S$8) and Chicken Cutlet Set (S$7.50), and side dishes like Cheese Fries (S$3.50) and Chicken Wings (S$1.60 each).\n' +

      'I gave the Fish & Chips (S$7.50) a try and it came with 2 huge pieces of breaded fish fillet, crinkle-cut fries, coleslaw, tartar sauce and baked beans. The fish was delightfully crispy and not oily, and the coleslaw was creamy and flavourful.\n' +

The former was a colourful bowl consisting of multi-coloured sago, tapioca pearls (similar to bubble tea), and those delightful pink chestnut pieces from a bowl of Thai red ruby. It had various interesting textures and the broth was rich and coconutty.\n' +
